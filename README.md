Text based adventure game: Hogwarts Sorting Hat Quiz
This is a text-based adventure game built using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows the player to take a fun quiz to determine which Hogwarts house they belong to: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff! Every answer influences the house scores, and the final result determines the house suited best for the player's personality.
Features:

o	Dynamic Scoring: The scores gained from each house are as a result of the player's answers. The house that scores the highest becomes their match.
o	Custom UI: The game is actually neat in designing as it stands with questions, answers, and results at par.
o	Final Results: The house of the player will appear in detail after the quiz.
o	Reset Option: The game can be reset after a quiz is taken.
